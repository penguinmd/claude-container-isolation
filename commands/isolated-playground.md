Read and execute the Container Isolation skill to set up a Playground mode environment for this project.

Use the SKILL.md file located at: ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/SKILL.md

IMPORTANT: Skip the mode selection step and proceed directly with Playground mode configuration:
- Mode: Playground (Maximum Security)
- Base OS: Ubuntu 24.04
- Storage: Named volume (isolated)
- Network: Locked (API only)
- MCP: Install in container
- Auth: Separate API key
- Execution: Safe mode

Only ask the user about skills synchronization, then proceed with all other setup steps automatically.
